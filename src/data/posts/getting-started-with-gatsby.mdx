# Getting Started with Gatsby: A Complete Guide

Gatsby is a powerful static site generator that uses React and GraphQL to create blazing-fast websites. In this guide, we'll explore how to get started with Gatsby and build your first project.

## What is Gatsby?

Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps. It combines the control and scalability of dynamically rendered sites with the speed of static-site generation.

## Key Features

- **Static Site Generation**: Pre-builds pages at build time
- **GraphQL Data Layer**: Unified data access
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Thousands of plugins
- **Performance**: Optimized out of the box
- **Developer Experience**: Hot reloading and great tooling

## Installation

To get started with Gatsby, you'll need Node.js installed on your system. Then run:

```bash
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

## Creating Your First Gatsby Site

```bash
gatsby new my-gatsby-site
cd my-gatsby-site
gatsby develop
```

## Project Structure

A typical Gatsby project has the following structure:

```
my-gatsby-site/
├── gatsby-config.js
├── gatsby-node.js
├── src/
│   ├── pages/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── templates/
│   └── images/
└── static/
```

## GraphQL and Data

Gatsby uses GraphQL to query data from various sources. Here's an example:

```graphql
query {
  allMarkdownRemark {
    edges {
      node {
        frontmatter {
          title
          date
        }
        excerpt
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Building for Production

When you're ready to deploy:

```bash
gatsby build
gatsby serve
```

## Conclusion

Gatsby provides an excellent foundation for building modern, performant websites. With its rich ecosystem and powerful features, it's a great choice for developers looking to create fast, scalable web applications.
