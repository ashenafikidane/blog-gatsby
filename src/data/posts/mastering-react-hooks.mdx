# Mastering React Hooks: A Deep Dive

React Hooks have revolutionized how we write React components. They allow us to use state and other React features without writing class components. Let's explore the most important hooks and how to use them effectively.

## What are React Hooks?

Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. They were introduced in React 16.8 and have become the standard way to write React components.

## useState Hook

The `useState` hook is the most fundamental hook that allows you to add state to functional components.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## useEffect Hook

The `useEffect` hook lets you perform side effects in function components. It serves the same purpose as `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` in React classes.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch data when component mounts
    fetch('/api/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, []); // Empty dependency array means this effect runs once

  return <div>{data ? data.title : 'Loading...'}</div>;
}
```

## Custom Hooks

You can create your own hooks to extract component logic into reusable functions.

```javascript
function useWindowSize() {
  const [size, setSize] = useState({
    width: window.innerWidth,
    height: window.innerHeight
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => {
      setSize({
        width: window.innerWidth,
        height: window.innerHeight
      });
    };

    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
  }, []);

  return size;
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always call hooks at the top level** - Don't call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions
2. **Only call hooks from React functions** - Call hooks from React function components or custom hooks
3. **Use the dependency array correctly** - Include all values from the component scope that change over time

## Common Patterns

### Conditional Effects

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (user) {
    document.title = `Welcome, ${user.name}`;
  }
}, [user]);
```

### Cleanup Functions

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = someAPI.subscribe();
  
  return () => {
    subscription.unsubscribe();
  };
}, []);
```

## Conclusion

React Hooks provide a more intuitive way to work with React's features. They make components more readable and easier to test. By mastering hooks, you'll be able to write more maintainable and efficient React applications.

Remember to always follow the Rules of Hooks and use the React DevTools to debug your hook usage!
